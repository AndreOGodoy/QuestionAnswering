3598;What did the Nature Medicine paper report?;the construction of a chimeric CoV with a bat CoV S gene (SHC014) in the backbone of a SARS CoV that has adapted to infect mice (MA15) and is capable of infecting human cells
3599;Why does the claim lack any scientific  basis?; because of significant divergence in the genetic sequence of this construct with the new SARS-CoV-2 (>5,000 nucleotides).
3600;How was the mouse-adapted SARS virus (MA15) generated?;by serial passage of an infectious wildtype SARS CoV clone in the respiratory tract of BALB/c mice.
3601;How did  the SARS-CoV gain elevated replication and lung pathogenesis in aged mice ?;due to six coding genetic mutations associated with mouse adaptation. 
3602;Why is it likely that MA15 is highly attenuated to  replicate in human cells?;due to the mouse adaptation.
3604;Why were civets proposed to be an intermediate host of the bat-CoVs, capable of spreading SARS CoV to humans?;t was proposed that the S gene from bat-derived CoV, unlike that from human patients-or civetsderived viruses, was unable to use human ACE2 as a receptor for entry into human cells 
3605;What was the finding  in 2013?;several novel bat coronaviruses were isolated from Chinese horseshoe bats and the bat SARS-like or SL-CoV-WIV1 was able to use ACE2 from humans, civets and Chinese horseshoe bats for entry 
3606; Why is it proposed that some bat SL-CoVs may be able to directly infect human hosts?;Combined with evolutionary evidence that the bat ACE2 gene has been positively selected at the same contact sites as the human ACE2 gene for interacting with SARS CoV [
3607;What was done to test if  an intermediate host may not be necessary and that some bat SL-CoVs may be able to directly infect human hosts. T; the exact S gene from bat coronavirus SL-SHC014 was synthesized and used to generate a chimeric virus in the mouse adapted MA15 SARS-CoV backbone. 
3608;What were the results of this test?;The resultant SL-SHC014-MA15 virus could indeed efficiently use human ACE2 and replicate in primary human airway cells to similar titres as epidemic strains of SARS-CoV. While SL-SHC014-MA15 can replicate efficiently in young and aged mouse lungs, infection was attenuated, and less virus antigen was present in the airway epithelium as compared to SARS MA15, which causes lethal outcomes in aged mice
3609;Why were experiments with SL-SHC014-MA15 chimeric virus were later restricted?;as gain of function (GOF) studies under the US government-mandated pause policy 
3610;Why is there  no credible evidence to support the claim that the SARS-CoV-2 is derived from the chimeric SL-SHC014-MA15 virus?;upon careful phylogenetic analyses by multiple international groups [5, 14] , the SARS-CoV-2 is undoubtedly distinct from SL-SHC014-MA15, with >6,000 nucleotide differences across the whole genome.
3611;What did the rumour that the virus was made by humans in the lab, claim?;that SARS-CoV-2 has HIV sequence in it and was thus likely generated in the laboratory. I
3612;What was reported in  a rebuttal paper led by an HIV-1 virologist Dr. Feng Gao?; they used careful bioinformatics analyses to demonstrate that the original claim of multiple HIV insertions into the SARS-CoV-2 is not HIV-1 specific but random 
3613;What happened to the report with initial claims?; Because of the many concerns raised by the international community, the authors who made the initial claim have already withdrawn this report.
3614;What is the difference between evolution and synthetic constructs?;Evolution is stepwise and accrues mutations gradually over time, whereas synthetic constructs would typically use a known backbone and introduce logical or targeted changes instead of the randomly occurring mutations that are present in naturally isolated viruses such as bat CoV RaTG13.
3615;What is the conclusion of this report?; there is currently no credible evidence to support the claim that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a laboratory-engineered CoV. It is more likely that SARS-CoV-2 is a recombinant CoV generated in nature between a bat CoV and another coronavirus in an intermediate animal host. 
3616;What is the conclusion of this report?;More studies are needed to explore this possibility and resolve the natural origin of SARS-CoV-2. We should emphasize that, although SARS-CoV-2 shows no evidence of laboratory origin, viruses with such great public health threats must be handled properly in the laboratory and also properly regulated by the scientific community and governments.

798;What can be a factor in using common vectors for the delivery of vaccines?;commonly employed vectors, for example Salmonella and adenovirus, often have pre-existing immune responses in the host and this has the potential to modify the subsequent immune response to a vectored antigen. 
800;Is a pre-existing immune response to commonly used delivery vector an advantage or a disadvantage?;for bacterial vectors there can in fact, in some cases, be an enhancement in immunogenicity, typically humoral, while for viral vectors pre-existing immunity is a hindrance for subsequent induction of cell-mediated responses.
802;What bacterial delivery vectors have been tested in animal hosts?; attenuated bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Vibrio cholerae, lactic acid bacteria (LAB), specifically Lactococcus lactis, Mycobacterium, Listeria, Shigella and Salmonella, have been tested for the targeted delivery of heterologous antigens of bacterial, viral and parasitic origin into a variety of animal hosts
804;Which bacteial delivery vectors have gained favor for vaccines?;Bacteria such as E. coli and lactic acid bacteria 
805;Why are E Coli and lactic acid are safe choices as delivery vectors for vaccines?;E. coli is a commensal and lactic acid bacteria are present in most fermented food items and are therefore naturally present in the host.

812;What is Listeria?; Listeria species are Gram-positive intracellular food-borne pathogens
813;What is the advantage of Listeria as a  delivery vector for vaccines?;"The advantages of Listeria are that it can invade a variety of cells, including antigen presenting cells (APCs). After invading the host cell, Listeria resides inside the phagosome; however, it can escape the phagosome with the help of listeriolysin O (LLO; Hly) and reside in the cytoplasm of the cells, thereby efficiently presenting antigen to both CD8 and CD4 T cells "
817;What are examples of  viral vectors for delivering vaccines?;recombinant vaccines are based on both DNA viruses (such as fowlpox virus-based vaccines which target avian influenza virus and fowlpox virus, or vaccinia virusbased vectors against the rabies virus in wildlife) and RNA viruses [such as Newcastle disease virus-based vaccines to be used in poultry or yellow fever virus (YFV)-based vaccines to be used in horses against West Nile virus] 
825;Which viral vaccine delivery vector was first licensed?;YFV (YF-17D strain) was the first to be licensed for use in humans, where the cDNAs encoding the envelope proteins of YFV were replaced with the corresponding genes of an attenuated Japanese encephalitis virus strain, SA14-14-2

833;Why are some poxvirus  ideally suited as vaccine delivery vectors?;They are ideal candidate vectors due to their large DNA-packing capacity and their thermal and genetic stability 
836;What is the advantage of adenovirus as vaccine delivery vector?;adenovirus (Ad) vector is another of the most widely evaluated vectors to date to express heterologous antigens, due to ease of production, safety profile, genetic stability, the ease of DNA genome manipulation, and the ability to stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses and induce both T and B cell responses 
838;What are important criteria for selecting vaccine delivery vectors?;a vaccine should be inexpensive, so that it can be administered to a large population at minimal cost
841;What are important criteria for selecting vaccine delivery vectors?;Safety is a major concern, as even a low level of toxicity is unacceptable 
845;What are important criteria for selecting vaccine delivery vectors?;long-lasting cellular and (where appropriate) humoral immune responses to the vectored antigen must be induced following administration of these vaccines, preferably with a single dose
858;What happens when a recipient of a vaccine has immune response to the delivery vector?;considering a vector such as Salmonella, if a host has previously been infected there will exist robust B and T memory responses, and as such, when a vaccination is delivered, an anamnestic response to the Salmonella antigens will be induced (while the response to the vectored antigen will be a primary response)
864;What is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?;for virally vectored antigens, the existence of pre-existing immunity to the vector (particularly neutralizing antibody) will restrict delivery of the virus into cells, thereby effectively reducing the dose of the vectored antigen. Again, this might be expected to result in a reduction in the antigenicity of the vectored antigen.
861;What is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?;theoretically reduce the exposure of the heterologous antigen to the immune system, as the vector is rapidly cleared.
870;What is an example  of the effect of immunity to the  delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?;mice that had been primed with Salmonella alone, and then boosted with Salmonella expressing tetC, induced much lower anti-tetC responses than mice that had not been primed. This argues strongly that prior immunological immunity to the vector can seriously dampen subsequent antigen-specific humoral responses.
874;What is the effect of host immune response to viral delivery vectors in the efficacy of vaccination?;pre-existing immunity is a major obstacle of many viralvectored vaccines, such as Ad serotype 5 or herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), where the rate of seroprevalence to these viruses is very high [40-45 % and 70 % (or more) of the US population, respectively] 
875;What is the effect of host immune response to  the viral delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?;Vector-specific antibodies may impede the induction of immune responses to the vaccine-encoded antigens, as they may reduce the dose and time of exposure of the target cells to the vaccinated antigens
876;What is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on  the efficacy of vaccination?; In a large-scale clinical trial (STEP) of an Ad serotype 5 (AdHu5)-based HIV-1 vaccine, the vaccines showed a lack of efficacy and tended to increase the risk of HIV-1 infection in vaccine recipients who had pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AdHu5 (
877;What are methods to avoid the effect vector immunity on the efficacy of vaccination?;" the use of vectors derived from nonhuman sources, using human viruses of rare serotypes (Kahl et al., 2010; Lasaro & Ertl, 2009) , heterologous prime-boost approaches (Liu et al., 2008) , homologous reimmunization (Steffensen et al., 2012) and removing key neutralizing epitopes on the surface of viral capsid proteins (Gabitzsch & Jones, 2011; Roberts et al., 2006) "
878;What are methods to  avoid the effect of vector immune response on the efficacy of vaccination?;"The inhibitory effect of pre-existing immunity can also be avoided by masking the Ad vector inside dendritic cells (DCs) (Steffensen et al., 2012) . In addition, mucosal vaccination or administration of higher vaccine doses can overcome pre-existing immunity problems (Alexander et al., 2012; Belyakov et al., 1999; Priddy et al., 2008; Xiang et al., 2003) .
"
879;How does cell-mediated immunity to viral delivery vector, reduce the immune response to vaccine?; this is because viruses will induce neutralizing antibody on the first dose, and in subsequent doses this antibody will limit the number of transduced cells, therefore limiting the responses. This is particularly a problem with a common viral vector such as Ad, where a large proportion of the population will have immunological memory against common serotypes
880;How can vectors for which host has immunity, be used differently to increase the efficacy of vaccination?;" it will be possible to utilize such vectors only by developing vaccines from alternative serotypes. It may be that a vector such as Pre-existing immunity against vaccine vectors attenuated influenza virus, with the ability to easily develop reassortants, will be useful in this context.

In addition, immunological memory in the form of opsonizing antibody certainly plays an important role in the early uptake of Salmonella by macrophages and DC. This may be beneficial, as the live bacterial vector used for delivery purposes harbours mutations in genes encoding proteins responsible for their survival in the animal host. This not only encumbers their ability to cause disease, making them safe live vectors, but also limits the number of replications. The presence of opsonizing antibodies should mean a higher level of bacterial uptake, leading to higher presentation to the immune system and therefore a better immune response."

2719;What is needed to elucidate zoonotic emergence?;A mechanistic understanding of the impact of bats’ virus hosting capacities, including uniquely constitutive immune pathways, on cellular-scale viral dynamics
2720;What is the conclusion of  this report?; heightened immune responses limit pathogen-induced cellular morbidity, which can facilitate the establishment of rapidly-propagating persistent infections within-host. Rapidly-transmitting viruses that have evolved with bat immune systems will likely cause enhanced virulence following emergence into secondary hosts with immune systems that diverge from those unique to bats.
2721;Why  have bats received attention in recent years?;for their role as reservoir hosts for emerging viral zoonoses, including rabies and related lyssaviruses, Hendra and Nipah henipaviruses, Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, and SARS coronavirus 
2722;What difference bats demonstrate compared to most non-Chiropteran mammals?;no obvious disease symptoms upon infection with pathogens that are highly virulent in non-volant mammals (Schountz et al., 2017) but may, instead, support viruses as longterm persistent infections, rather than transient, immunizing pathologies
2723;What suite of species-specific mechanisms do bats have to limit viral load?;"host receptor sequence incompatibilities for some bat-virus combinations (Ng et al., 2015; Takadate et al., 2020) and constitutive expression of the antiviral cytokine"
2724;How are mammalian cells typically rendered antiviral?; the presence of viral RNA or DNA in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells will induce secretion of type I interferon proteins (IFN-a and IFN-b), which promote expression and translation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in neighboring cells 
2725;In non-flying mammals, what what would be elicited by IFN expression upon viral infection?;widespread inflammation and concomitant immunopathology upon viral infection
2726;What do the bats do instead?;bats support unique adaptations to combat inflammation
2727;Why may the bats have this unique adaptation?;to mitigate metabolic damage induced during flight
2728;Why  was the field of virus dynamics developed?;to describe the mechanistic underpinnings of long-term patterns of steady-state viral load exhibited by patients in chronic phase infections with HIV, who appeared to produce and clear virus at equivalent rates 
2729;How are bats connected to fatal viral diseases?;bats are natural reservoirs for viruses that have some of the highest fatality rates of any viruses that people acquire from wild animals -including rabies, Ebola and the SARS coronavirus.
2730;What is  an example of anti-viral defense in bats?;some bats have an antiviral immune response called the interferon pathway perpetually switched on
2731;What would be caused by  this hyper-vigilance in most other mammals?; harmful inflammation
2732;How are bats different?;Bats, however, have adapted anti-inflammatory traits that protect them from such harm, include the loss of certain genes that normally promote inflammation.
2733;What bat species cells were compared?;-the black flying fox -in which the interferon pathway is always on, and another -the Egyptian fruit bat -in which this pathway is only activated during an infection.
2734;What was the conclusion of the study ?; In both bat species, the strongest antiviral responses were countered by the virus spreading more quickly from cell to cell. This suggests that bat immune defenses may drive the evolution of faster transmitting viruses, and while bats are well protected from the harmful effects of their own prolific viruses, other creatures like humans are not.
2735;What would be the benefit of learning more about bat's defenses and how they  drive virus evolution?;help scientists develop better ways to predict, prevent or limit the spread of viruses from bats to humans.

2738;Which cells express constitutive IFN-a?;PaKiT01 (Pteropus alecto) cell
2739;How were  the spread of GFP-expressing virus-infected cells across tissue monolayers tracked via inverted fluorescence microscopy?;Because plaque assays restrict viral transmission neighbor-to-neighbor in two-dimensional cellular space 
2740;How were  the spread of GFP-expressing virus-infected cells tracked?; For each infection trial, we monitored and re-imaged plates for up to 200 hr of observations or until total monolayer destruction, processed resulting images, and generated a time series of the proportion of infectious-cell occupied plate space across the duration of each trial (see Materials and methods). We used generalized additive models to infer the time course of all cell culture replicates and construct the multi-trial dataset to which we eventually fit our mechanistic transmission model for each cell line-virus-specific combinatio
2741;How was the modeling carried out?;an innovative combination of in vitro experimentation and within-host modeling to explore the impact of unique bat immunity on virus dynamics.
2742;What was the finding in this study?;that bat cell lines demonstrated a signature of enhanced interferon-mediated immune response, of either constitutive or induced form, which allowed for establishment of rapid within-host, cell-to-cell virus transmission rates 
2743;What supports the results?;by both data-independent bifurcation analysis of our mean field theoretical model, as well as fitting of this model to viral infection time series established in bat cell culture.
2744;What was additionally demonstrated?;the antiviral state induced by the interferon pathway protects live cells from mortality in tissue culture, resulting in in vitro epidemics of extended duration that enhance the probability of establishing a long-term persistent infection.
2745;What do  the studies suggest?;that viruses evolved in bat reservoirs possessing enhanced IFN capabilities could achieve more rapid within-host transmission rates without causing pathology to their hosts. Such rapidly-reproducing viruses would likely generate extreme virulence upon spillover to hosts lacking similar immune capacities to bats.
2746;What was the methodology for this study?;"we first developed a novel, within-host, theoretical model elucidating the effects of unique bat immunity, then undertook bifurcation analysis of the model's equilibrium properties under immune absent, induced, and constitutive assumptions. We considered a cell line to be constitutively immune if possessing any number of antiviral cells at disease-free equilibrium but allowed the extent of constitutive immunity to vary across the parameter range for "", the constitutive rate of antiviral acquisition. "
2747;What was demonstrated in deriving the equation for R 0?; invasion threshold is elevated at high values of constitutive antiviral acquisition,
2748;What is a conclusion of the modeling?;Constitutive immune processes can thus prohibit pathogen invasion, while induced responses, by definition, can only control infections post-hoc.
2749;What is a conclusion of the study?;Regardless of mechanism (induced or constitutive), interferon-stimulated antiviral cells appear to play a key role in maintaining longer term or persistent infections by safeguarding susceptible cells from rapid infection and concomitant cell death. 
2750;What do  fits to rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells suggest?;that the constitutive IFN-a expression characteristic of P. alecto cells may represent more of a constitutive immune priming process than a perpetual, functional, antiviral defense.
2751;What do the findings indicate?;enhanced IFN-mediated immune pathways in bat reservoirs may promote elevated within-host virus replication rates prior to cross-species emergence. 
2752;What is presented in this study?;general methods to study cross-scale viral dynamics, which suggest that within-host persistence is supported by robust antiviral responses characteristic of bat immune processes. 
2753;What is a conclusion of  this study?; Viruses which evolve rapid replication rates under these robust antiviral defenses may pose the greatest hazard for cross-species pathogen emergence into spillover hosts with immune systems that differ from those unique to bats.

1151;In addition to oral swabs, which tests detected the presence of 2019-nCOV virus?;the 2109-nCoV RNA was readily detected in the blood (6 of 57 patients) and the anal swabs (11 of 28 patients). 
1160;What  is the relationship between the presence of virus in blood and anal swabs and disease severity?;all of the 6 patients with detectable viral RNA in the blood cohort progressed to severe symptom stage, indicating a strong correlation of serum viral RNA with the disease severity (p-value = 0.0001). Meanwhile, 8 of the 11 patients with annal swab virus-positive was in severe clinical stage.
1168;Which patients were classified as severe in Chinese guidelines?;"Patients who were with at least one of the following symptom should be diagnosed to be severe case, 1) distress of respiratory with respiratory rate > = 30/min; 2) Oxygen saturation < = 93% in the rest state, and 3) arterial oxygen tension (PaO₂) over inspiratory oxygen fraction (FIO₂) of less than 300 mm Hg. In the blood detection cohort (Figure 1 (A)), patients who had at less one serum sample measurement with the PCR method were included. "
1169;What is the relationship between the presence of virus in blood sample and disease severity?; In the 57, 6 cases were detected to be blood positive, all of them (100%) were severe in symptom requiring special care attention, and the blood of the rest 51 cases was without detectable virus in the blood, only 12 of them (23.5%) were severe cases.
1171;What test could give an indication for special care for 2019-nCOV patients?;presence of viral RNA outside of the respiratory tract might herald the severity of the disease and alarm the requirement of special care

1172;What could be the implication of 2019-nCOV virus in anal swabs?;digestive tract might be one extrapulmonary site for virus replication
1173;What  could account for the high transmission rate of the 2019-nCOV virus?;Intensive structural analysis of the S protein of 2019-nCoV with the SARS-Coronavirus suggested that several critical residues in the viral spike protein might confer favourable interaction with human ACE2 [7] . Of note, ACE2 is also abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the small intestine besides the respiratory tract and is ubiquitously present in endothelial cells [8] , which might provide possible routes of transmission, and might account for the high transmission capacity of the new virus. 
1174;What could account for the dissemination of the 2019-nCOV virus across the whole body?;We propose that rampant coronavirus replication in pulmonary alveolus results in the breakdown of the alveolar vessel and the subsequent virus leakage into the blood flow, through which the virus is disseminated across the whole body. Then the virus succeeds in establishing reinfection in the digestive tract by using the highly expressed ACE2 receptor, which exacerbated the disease vice versa

3867;What do the acute exacerbations cause?;morbidity and sometimes mortality in patients, as well as resulting in major economic burdens worldwide
3869;What are acute exacerbations  usually due to ?;the presence of environmental factors such as allergens, pollutants, smoke, cold or dry air and pathogenic microbes in the airway
3870;What does the immune response elicited by these agents lead to?; infiltration of activated immune cells that further release inflammatory mediators that cause acute symptoms such as increased mucus production, cough, wheeze and shortness of breath. 
3871;Among these agents which is a major driver?;viral infection is one of the major drivers of asthma exacerbations accounting for up to 80-90% and 45-80% of exacerbations in children and adults respectively

3879;What is complied by the authors?;how viral induced changes to the upper airway may contribute to chronic airway inflammatory disease exacerbations, to provide a unified elucidation of the potential exacerbation mechanisms initiated from predominantly upper airway infections.
3880;Before linking respiratory viruses, what was linked to acute exacerbations?;"Despite being a major cause of exacerbation, reports linking respiratory viruses to acute exacerbations only start to emerge in the late 1950s (Pattemore et al., 1992) ; with bacterial infections previously considered as the likely culprit for acute exacerbation "
3881;What did the advent of PCR technology lead to?; viruses were recovered during acute exacerbations events and reports implicating their role emerged in the late 1980s
3882;What are the predominant viruses linked to airway inflammatory diseases?;Rhinovirus (RV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 
3883;What other viruses are implicated in acute exacerbations but to a much lesser extent?;parainfluenza virus (PIV), influenza virus (IFV) and adenovirus (AdV)
3884;What other viruses have been recently reported as contributing to acute exacerbations?; viruses including bocavirus (BoV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), certain coronavirus (CoV) strains, a specific enterovirus (EV) strain EV-D68, human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV)
3885;What are the common feature of these viruses share?;they can infect both the upper and/or lower airway, further increasing the inflammatory conditions in the diseased airway
3886;Where do the respiratory viruses primarily infect and replicate?;within airway epithelial cells 
3887;What happens  during the replication process?;the cells release antiviral factors and cytokines that alter local airway inflammation and airway niche 
3888;What does the inflammation lead to in healthy airways?;leads to type 1 inflammatory responses consisting of activation of an antiviral state and infiltration of antiviral effector cells. This eventually results in the resolution of the inflammatory response and clearance of the viral infection 
3891;How may the responses be different in a chronically inflamed airway?;" the responses against the virus may be impaired or aberrant, causing sustained inflammation and erroneous infiltration, resulting in the exacerbation of their symptoms (Mallia and Johnston, 2006; Dougherty and Fahy, 2009; Busse et al., 2010; Britto et al., 2017; Linden et al., 2019) . This is usually further compounded by the increased susceptibility of chronic airway inflammatory disease patients toward viral respiratory infections, thereby increasing the frequency of exacerbation as a whole"
3892;What will the review focus on?;"compiling and collating the current known mechanisms of viral-induced exacerbation of chronic airway inflammatory diseases; as well as linking the different viral infection pathogenesis to elucidate other potential ways the infection can exacerbate the disease"
3893;How will this review serve?;to provide further understanding of viral induced exacerbation to identify potential pathways and pathogenesis mechanisms that may be targeted as supplementary care for management and prevention of exacerbation.
3894;Why is this approach significant?;due to the current scarcity of antiviral drugs for the management of viral-induced exacerbations.
3941;What happens upon infection?;viruses evoke an inflammatory response as a means of counteracting the infection.
3942;How does the infected airway cell respond?;"Generally, infected airway epithelial cells release type I (IFNα/β) and type III (IFNλ) interferons, cytokines and chemokines such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein 1α (MIP-1α) and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Matsukura et al., 2013) ."
3943;What  does the epithelial proteins cause?;"enable infiltration of innate immune cells and of professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) that will then in turn release specific mediators to facilitate viral targeting and clearance, including type II interferon (IFNγ), IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-9, and IL-12 (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Singh et al., 2010; Braciale et al., 2012) ."
3944;What is the effect of these factors?;"These factors heighten local inflammation and the infiltration of granulocytes, T-cells and B-cells (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Braciale et al., 2012) . The increased inflammation, in turn, worsens the symptoms of airway diseases."
3945;What additional effects are caused  in patients with asthma and patients with CRS with nasal polyp ?;"viral infections such as RV and RSV promote a Type 2-biased immune response (Becker, 2006; Jackson et al., 2014; Jurak et al., 2018) . This amplifies the basal type 2 inflammation resulting in a greater release of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, RANTES and eotaxin and a further increase in eosinophilia, a key pathological driver of asthma and CRSwNP"
3946;What is the result of increased eosinophilia?;worsens the classical symptoms of disease and may further lead to life-threatening conditions due to breathing difficulties
3947;What are the effects for patients with COPD and patients with CRS without nasal polyp (CRSsNP) ?;"are more neutrophilic in nature due to the expression of neutrophil chemoattractants such as CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 (Cukic et al., 2012; Brightling and Greening, 2019) . The pathology of these airway diseases is characterized by airway remodeling due to the presence of remodeling factors such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) released from infiltrating neutrophils (Linden et al., 2019) . Viral infections in such conditions will then cause increase neutrophilic activation; worsening the symptoms and airway remodeling in the airway thereby exacerbating COPD, CRSsNP and even CRSwNP in certain cases "
3948; Which are the type 2 inflammatory cytokines expressed by the epithelial cells upon injury to the epithelial barrier?; IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP 
3949;Which cells lacking both B and T cell receptors but play a crucial role in secreting type 2 cytokines to perpetuate type 2 inflammation when activated ?; ILC2s are a group of lymphoid cells
3950;What is the effect cell death and injury to the epithelial barrier due to infection?;induce the expression of IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP, with heighten expression in an inflamed airway
3951;What happens when the 3 cytokines are expressed?;These 3 cytokines then work in concert to activate ILC2s to further secrete type 2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 which further aggravate the type 2 inflammation in the airway causing acute exacerbation (
3952;What  happens in the case of COPD?; increased ILC2 activation, which retain the capability of differentiating to ILC1, may also further augment the neutrophilic response and further aggravate the exacerbation
3954;What happens during viral infection of healthy individuals?;" these factors are not released to any great extent and do not activate an ILC2 response during viral infection in healthy individuals (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018a) ; despite augmenting a type 2 exacerbation in chronically inflamed airways (Jurak et al., 2018) . These classical mechanisms of viral induced acute exacerbations are summarized in Figure 1 "
3960;What happens upon viral infection in the airway?;antiviral state will be activated to clear the invading pathogen from the airway. Immune response and injury factors released from the infected epithelium normally would induce a rapid type 1 immunity that facilitates viral clearance. 
3961;What is the effect of the inflammation of the airway?;" However, in the inflamed airway, the cytokines and chemokines released instead augmented the inflammation present in the chronically inflamed airway, strengthening the neutrophilic infiltration in COPD airway, and eosinophilic infiltration in the asthmatic airway. The effect is also further compounded by the participation of Th1 and ILC1 cells in the COPD airway; and Th2 and ILC2 cells in the asthmatic airway."
3962;What increases the severity of exacerbations in the airway?;the synergistic effect of viral infection with other sensitizing agents 
3964;Why viruses do not need to directly infect the lower airway to cause an acute exacerbation?;he nasal epithelium remains the primary site of most infections.
3965;what is suggested by the fact that  not all viral infections of the airway lead to acute exacerbations?;"a more complex interplay between the virus and upper airway epithelium which synergize with the local airway environment in line with the ""united airway"" hypothesis "
3966;What is the effect of chronic airway inflammatory disease  in patients?;viral infections or their components persist in patients
3967;What is the effect of chronic airway inflammatory disease?;may further alter the local environment and contribute to current and future exacerbations
3968;Why should future studies  be performed using metagenomics in addition to PCR analysis ?;to determine the contribution of the microbiome and mycobiome to viral infections.
3969;What is highlighted by the authors in this review?; recent data regarding viral interactions with the airway epithelium that could also contribute to, or further aggravate, acute exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases.
3970;Who has impaired or reduced ability of viral clearance ?;Patients with chronic airway inflammatory diseases 
3971;What does their impairment stems from?;a type 2-skewed inflammatory response which deprives the airway of important type 1 responsive CD8 cells that are responsible for the complete clearance of virusinfected cells 
3972;Where is this  especially evident?;in weak type 1 inflammation-inducing viruses such as RV and RSV
3973;What are other  effects?;there are also evidence of reduced type I (IFNβ) and III (IFNλ) interferon production due to type 2-skewed inflammation, which contributes to imperfect clearance of the virus resulting in persistence of viral components, or the live virus in the airway epithelium 
3974;What is the  effect of viral components remaining in the airway?;antiviral genes such as type I interferons, inflammasome activating factors and cytokines remained activated resulting in prolong airway inflammation
3975;What do these factors do?;enhance granulocyte infiltration thus prolonging the exacerbation symptoms. Such persistent inflammation may also be found within DNA viruses such as AdV, hCMV and HSV, whose infections generally persist longer (Imperiale and Jiang, 2015) , further contributing to chronic activation of inflammation when they infect the airway
3976;What is also linked with the chronic inflammation that precedes the malignancies?;human papilloma virus (HPV), a DNA virus highly associated with head and neck cancers and respiratory papillomatosis,
3977;What should be investigated in the future?; the role of HPV infection in causing chronic inflammation in the airway and their association to exacerbations of chronic airway inflammatory diseases, which is scarcely explored
3978;What further can viral persistence lead to?;viral persistence which lead to continuous expression of antiviral genes may also lead to the development of steroid resistance, which is seen with RV, RSV, and PIV infection
3979;What  effect the use of steroids to  suppress inflammation can have?;may also cause the virus to linger longer in the airway due to the lack of antiviral clearance
3980;What should be further focus of research?;The concomitant development of steroid resistance together with recurring or prolong viral infection 
3981;Which viruses may not cause prolonged inflammation due to strong induction of antiviral clearance?;"viruses that induce strong type 1 inflammation and cell death such as IFV (Yan et al., 2016; Guibas et al., 2018) and certain CoV (including the recently emerged COVID-19 virus)"
3982;What do these infections cause?;"massive damage and cell death to the epithelial barrier, so much so that areas of the epithelium may be completely absent post infection (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2019) . Factors such as RANTES and CXCL10, which recruit immune cells to induce apoptosis, are strongly induced from IFV infected epithelium "
3983;What do the necroptotic factors such as RIP3 do?; further compounds the cell deaths in IFV infected epithelium . The massive cell death induced may result in worsening of the acute exacerbation due to the release of their cellular content into the airway, further evoking an inflammatory response in the airway 
3984;What  may the destruction of the epithelial barrier  cause?; further contact with other pathogens and allergens in the airway which may then prolong exacerbations or results in new exacerbations.
3985;What may the epithelial destruction cause?;may also promote further epithelial remodeling during its regeneration as viral infection induces the expression of remodeling genes such as MMPs and growth factors . Infections that cause massive destruction of the epithelium, such as IFV, usually result in severe acute exacerbations with non-classical symptoms of chronic airway inflammatory diseases.
3986;What is recommended that patients with chronic airway inflammatory disease?; receive their annual influenza vaccination as the best means to prevent severe IFV induced exacerbation.
3987;What is another mechanism that viral infections use to drive acute exacerbations?;the induction of vasodilation or tight junction opening factors which may increase the rate of infiltration.

882;What are ways in  which 2019-nCOV is transmitted?;We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral–fecal route.
883;Is oral swab for detecting 2019-nCOV infection, sufficient?;the current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019-nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative.
884;Is oral swab for detecting 2019-nCOV infection, sufficient?; patients infected with 2019-nCoV may harbour the virus in the intestine at the early or late stage of disease. It is also worth to note none of the patients with viremia blood had positive swabs. These patients would likely be considered as 2019-nCoV negative through routine surveillance, and thus pose a threat to other people.

3835;What were the two contexts for transmission?;sporadic cases among travellers from China (14 cases) and cases who acquired infection due to subsequent local transmission in Europe (21 cases).
3836;What  does the analysis show on the difference between locally acquired cases vs imported cases?;that the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation/case isolation was about 3 days longer for locally acquired cases than for imported cases.
3837;What is required for locally acquired cases?;"significant resources for contact tracing and quarantine, and countries should be prepared to allocate considerable public health resources during the containment phase, should local clusters emerge in their population. In addition, prompt sharing of information on cases and contacts through international notification systems such as the International Health Regulations (IHR) mechanism and the European Commission's European Early Warning and Response System is essential to contain international spread of infection.
"
3838;What was common to all imported cases?;had a history of travel to China
3839;What testing and detection are needed?;Testing of suspected cases based on geographical risk of importation needs to be complemented with additional approaches to ensure early detection of local circulation of COVID-19, including through testing of severe acute respiratory infections in hospitals irrespectively of travel history as recommended in the WHO case definition updated on 27 February 2020 
3840;What did the finding prompt ECDC to do?;include fever among several clinical signs or symptoms indicative for the suspected case definition.

4134;What does  the author anticipate international efforts will do?; will enable the tapping of useful new biological functions and processes, methods for controlling infection, and the deployment of symbiotic or subclinical viruses in new therapies and biotechnologies that are so crucially needed.
4138;What do pathogens do upon infection?;stimulate expression of numerous host inflammatory factors that support recruitment and activation of immune cells. 
4139;What is the flip side ?;this same process also causes immunopathology when prolonged or deregulated.

";emerging human pathogens that possess enormous genomes of up to several megabases in size encoding hundreds of proteins with unique and unknown functions.
4166;What do the recent efforts indicate regarding hundreds of human and avian infectious viruses?; the true number may be in the millions and many harbour zoonotic potential. 
4167;What is neo-virology?; an emerging field engaged in cataloguing and characterising this biodiversity through a global consortium.
4168;What is predicted these efforts on neo-virology will unlock?;a vast wealth of currently unexplored biodiversity, leading to biotechnologies and treatments that leverage the host-virus interactions developed throughout evolution.

3847;What serious question was raised?;as to whether or not our seasonal or pandemic flu might have another reservoir host.
3848;What is a recent discovery?;Bat is believed to harbor many more viruses than we ever thought as a reservoir host or even a susceptible host 
3849;Which bat virus have been found to be linked with diseases?;potential human infecting HKU-1, 4, 5 and 9 [17, 18] . Recent MERS-CoV infection is another example for severe disease caused by used-to-be-less pathogenic coronaviruses. Shi and colleagues [19] by using NGS have discovered many unknown animal viruses from bat, especially some important paramyxoviruses and reoviruses. Filovirus has also been identified in bat with potential severe outcomes. Lyssaviruses (with many genotypes, including rabies virus) in the Rhabdoviridae family have been linked with severe fatal human cases, even in the developed countries, including Australia, with the bites of bats in the city [20, 21] .
3850;What assay played an important role?;reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
1057;What was the death toll in the 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza epidemic?;50 million deaths worldwide
1058;How many people were infected during the 1918 Spanish Influenza epidemic?;"An estimated one third of the world’s population (or
z500 million persons) were infected and had clinical-
ly apparent illnesses"
1059;What was the case fatality rate in the 1918 Spanish Influenza epidemic?;"Case-
fatality rates were >2.5%, compared to <0.1% in other
inﬂuenza pandemics"
1060;What was the death toll in the 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza epidemic?;"Total deaths were estimated at
z50 million (577) and were arguably as high as 100 mil-
lion "
1062;Are the modern day Influenza viruses related to the 1918 Spanish Influenza virus?;" All inﬂuenza A pandemics since that time, and
indeed almost all cases of inﬂuenza A worldwide (except-
ing human infections from avian Viruses such as H5N1 and
H7N7), have been caused by descendants of the 1918
Virus, including “drifted” H1N1 Viruses and reassorted
H2N2 and H3N2 Viruses."
1063;Why is the Spanish Influenza virus the Mother of the modern influenza viruses?;"The latter are composed of key
genes from the 1918 Virus, updated by subsequently-incor—
porated avian inﬂuenza genes that code for novel surface

 

*Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rockville, Maryland, USA;
and TNational Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA

proteins, making the 1918 Virus indeed the “mother” of all
pandemics."
1064;When was it  determined that the 1918  pandemic was caused by the H1N1 Influenza virus?;"That question did not begin to be resolved until the 1930s,
when closely related inﬂuenza Viruses (now known to be
H1N1 Viruses) were isolated, ﬁrst from pigs and shortly
thereafter from humans. Seroepidemiologic studies soon
linked both of these viruses to the 1918 pandemic"
1065;Did the Spanish Influenza or Swine flu or the H1N1 virus disappear in humans for some time?;" descendants of the 1918
Virus still persists enzootically in pigs. They probably also
circulated continuously in humans, undergoing gradual
antigenic drift and causing annual epidemics, until the
1950s. With the appearance of a new H2N2 pandemic
strain in 1957 (“Asian ﬂu”), the direct H1N1 Viral descen-
dants 0f the 1918 pandemic strain disappeared from human
circulation entirely, although the related lineage persisted
enzootically in pigs."
1066;When did the Swine Flu (Spanish Influenza) virus reappear in humans?;" But in 1977, human H1N1 Viruses
suddenly “reemerged” from a laboratory freezer (9). They
continue to circulate endemically and epidemically."
1068;What descendant  lineages of the swine flu (Spanish Influenza) virus were identified in 2006?;" 2 major descendant lineages of the 1918
H1N1 Virus, as well as 2 additional reassortant lineages,
persist naturally: a human epidemic/endemic H1N1 line-
age, a porcine enzootic H1N1 lineage (so-called classic
swine ﬂu), and the reassorted human H3N2 Virus lineage,
which like the human H1N1 Virus, has led to a porcine
H3N2 lineage."
1070;Are the modern descendant influenza viruses as dangerous as the 1918 parent swine flu (Spanish Influenza) H1N1 virus?;"None of these Viral descendants, however,
approaches the pathogenicity of the 1918 parent Virus."
1072;How dangerous are the modern H1N1 (swine flu) and the H3N2 (Influenza A) viruses compared  to the 1918 H1N1 (swine flu Spanish Influenza)  viruses?;"the human H1N1 and H3N2 lin-
eages have both been associated with substantially lower
rates ofillness and death than the virus of 1918. In fact, cur-
rent H1N1 death rates are even lower than those for H3N2
lineage strains (prevalent from 1968 until the present)."
1073;Are the descendant H1N1 strains of the 1918 H1N1 swine flu (Spanish Influenza) virus, still prevalent?;"H1N1 Viruses descended from the 1918 strain, as well as 
H3N2 Viruses, have now been cocirculating worldwide for
29 years and show little evidence of imminent extinction."
1075;Is the origin and epidemiology of the 1918 swine flu (Spanish Influenza) known?;"ongoing studies to map Virulence
factors are yielding interesting results. The 1918 sequence
data, however, leave unanswered questions about the ori-
gin of the Virus (19) and about the epidemiology of the
pandemic."
1082;What is the geographical origin of the H1N1 swine flu ?;"Historical and epidemiologic data are inade-
quate to identify the geographic origin of the Virus (21),
and recent phylogenetic analysis of the 1918 Viral genome
does not place the Virus in any geographic context"
1087;Is the geographical origin of the 1918 H1N1 swine flu known?;"Confounding deﬁnite assignment of a geographic
point of origin, the 1918 pandemic spread more or less
simultaneously in 3 distinct waves during an z12-month
period in 191871919, in Europe, Asia, and North America
(the ﬁrst wave was best described in the United States in
March 1918)"
1088;What is an unique feature of the 1918 swine flu?;"the simultaneous (or nearly simultaneous) infection
of humans and swin"
1089;What season or  time of the year do the new strains of influenza emerge?;"Historical records since the 16th century suggest that
new inﬂuenza pandemics may appear at any time of year,
not necessarily in the familiar annual winter patterns of
interpandemic years,"
1090;Once appeared, when do the influenza like diseases occur in subsequent years?;"confronted by the selection pressures of population immu-
nity, these pandemic Viruses begin to drift genetically and
eventually settle into a pattern of annual epidemic recur-
rences caused by the drifted Virus variants."
1091;When did the first wave of the H1N1 swine flu (Spanish Influenza) occur?;" a ﬁrst or spring wave
began in March 1918 and spread unevenly through the
United States, Europe, and possibly Asia over the next 6
months"
1092;What was the death rate in the first wave of the 1918 swine flu pandemic?;" Illness rates were high, but death rates
in most locales were not appreciably above normal."
1093;When were the second and the third wave of the 1918-1919 swine flu pandemic?;" A sec-
ond or fall wave spread globally from September to
November 1918 and was highly fatal. In many nations, a
third wave occurred in early 1919 "
1094;What was the primary difference between the first wave and the 2nd and 3rd wave of the 1918-1919 swine flu pandemic?;"the much higher fre-
quency of complicated, severe, and fatal cases in the last 2
waves."
1096;Why the human influenza viruses do not disappear after herd immunity is developed?;"The occurrence, and to some extent the severity, of recur-
rent annual outbreaks, are driven by Viral antigenic drift,
with an antigenic variant Virus emerging to become domi-
nant"
1099;What are the circumstances that promote the spread of influenza virus?;" lower environ-
mental temperatures and human nasal temperatures (bene-
ﬁcial to thermolabile Viruses such as inﬂuenza), optimal
humidity, increased crowding indoors, and imperfect ven-
tilation due to closed windows and suboptimal airﬂow"
1101;Do seasonal temperatures and humidity explain  the appearance of the three waves of the 1918 swine flu?;"such factors cannot explain the 3 pandemic
waves of 1918-1919, which occurred in the spring-sum-
mer, summer—fall, and winter (of the Northern
Hemisphere), respectively. The ﬁrst 2 waves occurred at a
time of year normally unfavorable to inﬂuenza Virus
spread. The second wave caused simultaneous outbreaks
in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres from
September to November. "
1105;Which virus samples  from the 1918 swine flu pandemic have been identified?;"pandemic Virus samples we have
yet identiﬁed are from second-wave patients"
1106;Are viruses in the first and third waves of the 1918 swine flu pandemic same or derived from the virus from the second wave of the swine flu?;"nothing
can yet be said about whether the ﬁrst (spring) wave, or for
that matter, the third wave, represented circulation of the
same Virus or variants of it"
1107;Was the 1918 swine flu virus novel to humans are was it derived from older viruses?;"Viral sequence data now suggest that the entire 1918
Virus was novel to humans in, or shortly before, 1918, and
that it thus was not a reassortant Virus produced from old
existing strains that acquired 1 or more new genes"
1108;Do avian flu viruses change over long periods?;"Inﬂuenza Virus gene
sequences from a number ofﬁxed specimens ofwild birds
collected circa 1918 show little difference from avian
Viruses isolated today, indicating that avian Viruses likely
undergo little antigenic change in their natural hosts even
over long periods"
1109;What  is the typical age profile of mortality in Influenza diseases?;"The curve of inﬂuenza deaths by age at death has histor-
ically, for at least 150 years, been U-shaped (Figure 2),
exhibiting mortality peaks in the very young and the very
old, with a comparatively low frequency of deaths at all
ages in between"
1110;What was the age profile of mortality in the 1918 swine flu?;"age-speciﬁc death rates in the
1918 pandemic exhibited a distinct pattern that has not been
documented before or since: a “W—shaped” curve, similar to
the familiar U-shaped curve but with the addition of a third
(middle) distinct peak of deaths in young adults z20410
years of age"
1111;Which age group was most susceptible to die during the 1918 swine flu pandemic?;"Persons 65 years of age in 1918 had a dispro-
portionately high inﬂuenza incidence"
1112;What was the death rate among children during the 1918 swine flu pandemic?;"those 5 to 14
years of age accounted for a disproportionate number of
inﬂuenza cases, but had a much lower death rate from
inﬂuenza and pneumonia than other age groups. "
1113;What theory provides partial explanation for the age-specific profile of the death rate in the 1918 swine flu pandemic?;" the 1918 Virus had an intrinsically high Virulence, tem-
pered only in those patients who had been born before
1889, e.g., because of exposure to a then-circulating Virus
capable of providing partial immunoprotection against the
1918 Virus strain only in persons old enough (>35 years) to
have been infected during that prior era "
1114;Is there a difference in the pathologic feature and course of disease between modern influenza pandemics and the 1918 swine flu pandemic?;" the 1918
pandemic was different in degree, but not in kind, from
previous and subsequent pandemics. Despite the extraordi-
nary number of global deaths, most inﬂuenza cases in
1918 (>95% in most locales in industrialized nations) were
mild and essentially indistinguishable from inﬂuenza cases
today. "
1117;Could the 1918 swine flu virus been controlled  by modern day drugs or vaccines?;"the 1918 and 1918-like Viruses would be
as sensitive as other typical Virus strains to the Food and
Drug Administrationiapproved antiinﬂuenza drugs riman-
tadine and oseltamivir."
1120;Why was there such a high death rate in the 19118 swine flu pandemic?;"Clinically and pathologically, these
high death rates appear to be the result of several factors,
including a higher proportion of severe and complicated
infections of the respiratory tract, rather than involvement
of organ systems outside the normal range of the inﬂuenza
Virus. Also, the deaths were concentrated in an unusually
young age group"
1123;Is the molecular basis of human adaptation of a virus understood?;"While data bearing
on inﬂuenza Virus human cell adaptation (e.g., receptor
binding) are beginning to be understood at the molecular
level, the basis for Viral adaptation to efﬁcient human-to-
human spread, the chief prerequisite for pandemic emer-
gence, is unknown for any inﬂuenza Virus."

3693;How does the genome of 2019-vCOV compare with   SARS like viruses and SARS-COV?;Overall, the genome of 2019-nCoV has 89% nucleotide identity with bat SARS-like-CoVZXC21 and 82% with that of human SARS-CoV. The phylogenetic trees of their orf1a/b, Spike, Envelope, Membrane and Nucleoprotein also clustered closely with those of the bat, civet and human SARS coronaviruses.
3694;How different is it from SARS-related viruses?;the external subdomain of Spike’s receptor binding domain of 2019-nCoV shares only 40% amino acid identity with other SARS-related coronaviruses. 
3695;What novel features does the genome have?; its orf3b encodes a completely novel short protein. Furthermore, its new orf8 likely encodes a secreted protein with an alpha-helix, following with a beta-sheet(s) containing six strands.
3696; What is important for understanding the origin and evolution of this novel lineage B betacoronavirus.;Learning from the roles of civet in SARS and camel in MERS, hunting for the animal source of 2019-nCoV and its more ancestral virus
3697;What are Coronaviruses?;Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to the subfamily Coronavirinae, family Coronavirdiae, order Nidovirales.
3698;What are four generas?;Alphacoronavirus (αCoV), Betacoronavirus (βCoV), Deltacoronavirus (δCoV), and Gammacoronavirus (γCoV) 
3699;What do  evolutionary analyses show?; that bats and rodents are the gene sources of most αCoVs and βCoVs, while avian species are the gene sources of most δCoVs and γCoVs.
3700;What are the examples that have emerged as human pathogens?;severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) which emerged in China in 2002-2003 to cause a large-scale epidemic with about 8000 infections and 800 deaths, and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) which has caused a persistent epidemic in the Arabian Peninsula since 2012
3701;Where did these viruses originate before crossing the barrier to infect humans?;these viruses have likely originated from bats and then jumped into another amplification mammalian host [the Himalayan palm civet (Paguma larvata) for SARS-CoV and the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) for MERS-CoV] 
3702;What COVs were known to infect humans before December 2019?;6 CoVs were known to infect human, including 2 αCoV (HCoV-229E and HKU-NL63) and 4 βCoV (HCoV-OC43 [ 
3703;What do HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 cause?;self-limiting upper respiratory infections in immunocompetent hosts and occasionally lower respiratory tract infections in immunocompromised hosts and elderly 
3704;What is the contrast with SARS-COV and MERS=COV?; SARS-CoV (lineage B βCoV) and MERS-CoV (lineage C βCoV) may cause severe lower respiratory tract infection with acute respiratory distress syndrome and extrapulmonary manifestations, such as diarrhea, lymphopenia, deranged liver and renal function tests, and multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, among both immunocompetent and immunocompromised hosts with mortality rates of ∼10% and ∼35%, respectively 
3705;What was the authors' recent report on?;a familial cluster of 2019-nCoV infection in a Shenzhen family with travel history to Wuhan 
3706;What is analyzed in this study?;a 2019-nCoV complete genome from a patient in this familial cluster and compared it with the genomes of related βCoVs to provide insights into the potential source and control strategies.
3707;What genome sequence was available for this study?;2019-nCoV HKU-SZ-005b was available at GenBank (accession no. MN975262)
3708;What strains were included in  this study?;strains collected from human, bats, and Himalayan palm civet between 2003 and 2018, with one 229E coronavirus strain as the outgroup.

3715;How are 2019-nCOV and SARS-COV similar?;There are no remarkable differences between the orfs and nsps
3716;Where is the major distinction?; in orf3b, Spike and orf8 but especially variable in Spike S1 and orf8 which were previously shown to be recombination hot spots.
3717;What do the S1 and S2 subunits of spike glycoprotein contain?;The S1 subunit contains a signal peptide, followed by an N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD), while the S2 subunit contains conserved fusion peptide (FP), heptad repeat (HR) 1 and 2, transmembrane domain (TM), and cytoplasmic domain (CP).
3718;What are the chacateristics of the S2 subunit?;S2 subunit of 2019-nCoV is highly conserved and shares 99% identity with those of the two bat SARS-like CoVs (SL-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45) and human SARS-CoV 
3719;What would be the benefit of the identity of the S2 unit?; the broad spectrum antiviral peptides against S2 would be an important preventive and treatment modality for testing in animal models before clinical trials 
3720;How do the S1 subunits compare with that of SARS-likeCOV and human SARS-COV?;Though the S1 subunit of 2019-nCoV shares around 70% identity to that of the two bat SARS-like CoVs and human SARS-CoV (Figure 3(A) ), the core domain of RBD (excluding the external subdomain) are highly conserved (
3721;Where are the amino acid differences?;Most of the amino acid differences of RBD are located in the external subdomain,

3724;How do most bat SARSr-COV differ from 2019-nCOV and  human SARS-COV?;bat SARSr-CoVs have two stretches of deletions in the spike receptor binding domain (RBD) when compared with that of human SARS-CoV
3726;Which strains  do  not have such deletions?;Yunnan strains such as the WIV1
3727;What is the consequence of  lack of deletions in Yunnan strains?;can use human ACE2 as a cellular entry receptor. 
3728;Being closest to 2019-nCoV, which species do the two bat SARS-related coronavirus ZXC21 and ZC45 infect?;can infect suckling rats and cause inflammation in the brain tissue, and pathological changes in lung & intestine. 
3729;What would lessen the likelihood of jumping the barrier?;The two retained deletion sites in the Spike genes of ZXC21 and ZC45
3730;What do the results indicate?; that different orf3b proteins display different IFN antagonist activities and this function is independent of the protein's nuclear localization, suggesting a potential link between bat SARS-related-CoV orf3b function and pathogenesis.
3731;What  is orf8?;an accessory protein found in the Betacoronavirus lineage B coronaviruses
3732;What orf8 length do Human SARS-CoVs isolated from early-phase patients, all civet SARS-CoVs, and other bat SARS-related CoVs contain?;fulllength orf8
3733;From where have the original SARS-CON orf8 been acquired?;two bat SARS-related-CoV (Bat-CoV YNLF_31C and YNLF_34C) 
3734;What does the orf8 derived from 2019-nCOV belong to?;the group that includes the closest genome sequences of bat SARS-related-CoV ZXC21 and ZC45. 
3735;What is the  relation between the new2019-nCOV and the conserved orf8?;the new 2019-nCoV orf8 is distant from the conserved orf8 
3736;orf8 was shown to do  what?;to trigger intracellular stress pathways and activates NLRP3 inflammasomes
3737;What high possibility does the novel  orf8 have?;to form a protein with an alpha-helix, following with a betasheet(s) containing six strands 
3738;What is the summary of this report?;2019-nCoV is a novel lineage B Betacoronavirus closely related to bat SARS-related coronaviruses. It also has unique genomic features which deserves further investigation to ascertain their roles in viral replication cycle and pathogenesis. More animal sampling to determine its natural animal reservoir and intermediate animal host in the market is important. This will shed light on the evolutionary history of this emerging coronavirus which has jumped into human after the other two zoonotic Betacoroanviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV.

1912;Who are expected to be particularly susceptible?;Populations affected by humanitarian crises 
1913;Why populations may be particularly susceptible?;due to displacement, crowded housing, malnutrition, inadequate water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) tools, and stigmatization
1914;What is the impact of disease outbreaks?;Disease outbreaks further reduce access to limited healthcare, which is increasingly disrupted by attacks on health facilities and the persistent overburdening of health systems. 
1915;What represents a barrier to testing?; limited public health, laboratory, and primary care services 
1916;Where are difficulties are exacerbated during humanitarian crises?;Providing the limited healthcare worker cadre with appropriate training and personal protective equipment, and ensuring a continuous supply chain 
1917;What can prevent contact tracing?; Frequent displacement and limited contact information 
1918;What is an example of intractable structural challenge?;overcrowding limit the implementation of both quarantine of those exposed and isolation of those who are ill. 
1919;What should be the priority of the national and international bodies trying to prevent the pandemic?;increased vulnerabilities, humanitarian crises
1920;What  resources need to be identified?;to protect healthcare workers, develop and deploy rapid testing, improve surveillance, and enact quarantine and isolation of contacts and cases.
1921;What is an effective public health hygiene?; Respiratory hygiene i
1922;What has been demonstrated to  be  effective for prevention?;hand hygiene, safe cough practice, and social distancing [
1923;What has increased hand washing?; the distribution of soap to households in humanitarian settings has been shown to increase handwashing by over 30%
1924;What is hand washing to protect one's own health  consistent with?;the rights to dignity and to fully participate in decisions related to assistance in humanitarian crises. 
1925;What is possible in many resource -limited  settings?;Widespread introduction of alcohol-based hand rubs 
1926;What is the foremost authority on minimum standards for humanitarian assistance?;The Sphere Handbook, a collection of rights-based guidelines for humanitarian response
1927;For what  there is evidence for  the efficacy of hand washing?; reducing both bacterial and viral pathogen transmission,
1928;What are humanitarian WASH standards  based on?;evidence pertaining to the prevention of illnesses transmitted by the faecal-oral route, with the focus on hand hygiene proximate to latrines
1929;What confers a high risk of  gender  based violence?;latrines in crisis settings are often shared and distant from residential shelters,
1930;What is the deterrent effect of gender based violence around latrines?; for accessing latrine-adjacent handwashing stations, particularly for hand hygiene to prevent respiratory pathogen transmission.
1931;What  will maximize the effectiveness of interventions?;Crisis-affected community engagement is integral in pandemic planning,
1932;What will happen without the adaptation of existing standards?; mitigation plans will fall short of health and human rights obligations in outbreak response
1933;What is essential when pandemics threaten vulnerable populations?;Transparent and credible information-sharing mechanisms 
1934;What is a necessary component of effective health  governance?;Diplomacy bridging long-standing mistrust of public health and biomedical interventions and facilitating engagement with contentious actors 
259;Approximately how many people died during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic?;During the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, between 21 and 25 million people died of influenza worldwide.
286;What social and economic factors  contributed to the large fatality rate in the 1918 influenza pandemic?;Malnutrition weakened the human immune system and made a person more vulnerable to infectious diseases like tuberculosis and influenza, therefore, hunger and malnutrition were indirectly responsible for millions of deaths in the world in that period of time.
291;What problems were faced by medical staff during the 1918 epidemic?; in 1918 and 1919, physicians and nurses almost had nothing in their hands to help individuals who were infected by influenza viruses. T
295;What helpful drugs are available now to control the disease or to provide palliative care for influenza patients?; Today, although we still do not have very effective, powerful, and practical anti-influenza drugs available, we at least have some improved, useful, and helpful anti-viral drugs like zanamivir, and effective, convenient anti-cold medicines like Tylenol or Advil.
297;How has the mortality rate due to influenza declined in USA over past decades?;" in the United States of America, the influenza classed mortality rate declined from 10.2/100,000 in the 1940s to 0.56/100,000 in the 1990s; and the classed mortality rates of 1957-1958 and 1968-1969 influenza pandemics were not remarkably different from the non-pandemic seasons"
299;Is there an Influenza vaccine?;We do not have a universal vaccine to prevent all influenza virus infections, but we can make effective vaccines to a specific influenza virus strain in a short time.
300;for the 2009 influenza pandemic, what were the case fatality rates?;"that most cases of H1N1 influenza A virus infections were mild, the symptomatic case fatality rate was only 0.005% in New Zealand (16) ; and in New York City, the case fatality rate was 0.0094-0.0147% for persons ≥65 years old, and for those of 0-17 years old, the case fatality rate was 0.0008-0.0012% (17) ."
301;What  factors would contribute now to the faster rates of influenza infections?;"Nowadays, we travel faster, and we travel more frequently and globally, and we have more complicated social activities and lifestyles, thereby increasing the chances of viral mutation; and we realize that influenza viruses are even easier to reassort, recombine, and mutate in nature than many other RNA viruses."
302;What factors would be responsible in future for the prevention of an Influenza pandemic?; influenza virus infections are controllable and preventable, with the increased population health and immunity, with the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System, and with standard/routine epidemiological practices, and with new effective anti-viral agents and vaccines in production in the future. 
303;What was the detected fatality rate of H7N9 Avian flu?;" the detected 32.14% (45/140, one case from Taiwan, and one case from Hong Kong) (22, 23).
"
304;Why would real  case fatality rate for the H7N9 be lower than detected rate?;most people usually think a common cold is a very common and normal occurrence, and they don't take flu-like illnesses seriously. In most situations, they would just stay home and take some medicines. Only those who have very severe flu-like symptoms would see doctors, and thereby be detected and diagnosed, accordingly the real case fatality rate should be much lower
5315;What is the structure of the Ebolavirus?;single-strand RNA filoviruses
5316;When was the West African Ebolavirus outbreak?;2013-2016
5317;What animals are considered to be maintenance hosts to the Ebolavirus?;African bats
5318;What do circles indicate in Figure 1?;a maintenance function play by the host(s)
5319;What do arrows indicate in Figure 1?;infectious transmission pathways between hosts
